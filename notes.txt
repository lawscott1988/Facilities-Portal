I created the basic template for the index page. I'm still not
quite sure what I want to have on the first page or how the
exact layout of the website will be. Perhaps I need to sit
down and make some wireframes first to get a basic idea of how
I want the layout to be

TO DO:
	- Make wireframes

I've started making the wireframes for the main page, view actions,
log actions pages. Both for mobile and large screen views. I also
added the log action form to the logaction.html page. I learnt quite
a bit about form fucntionality and buttons doing this.

I made the view actions page template. I began creation of the
action task log information section. This will eventually change
to be interactive so users can log and view their actions, as
well as the action team to be able to update and complete these
actions.

I've finished the front-end for the buttons on the key-system page.
I've also added a new navbar but it's needs some aesthetical changes.

TO DO:
	- add dropdown menu feature to navbar
	- change aesthetics of navbar to match green colour themes
